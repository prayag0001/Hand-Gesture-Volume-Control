This project utilizes hand gestures to control the volume of the system. It uses computer vision techniques to detect hand landmarks and interprets gestures to 
adjust the volume accordingly.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Numpy
- Mediapipe
- PyCaw
- Comtype

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   git clone https://github.com/prayag0001/Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control.git

2. Install the required Python packages:
